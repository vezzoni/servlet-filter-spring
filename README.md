# Servlet Filter & Spring integration
This lab shows how to setup the Servlet Filter's awareness about the Spring components in order to use the Spring Dependency Injection. It is built with Maven which provides this project to be IDE agnostic. So, it is simple to build and run it:

* mvn clean install
* mvn jetty:run

Then, open the http://localhost:8080/servlet-filter-spring in some web browser.
